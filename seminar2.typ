= General
- Arrays are poggers, quick lookups
- ALWAYS DO THE EASIEST THING FIRST
- minheaps/priority queues is important for graphs/later excercises

= Chopping wood
- last number >= n + 1, otherwise we've cut the largest number -> ERROR
- There can never be more than one valid tree
- count occurance. [idx: occurance of i]
- everything that's 0 occurance is "usable"
- choose smallest i with 0 count, then remove 1 from occurance of whichever node we "added" i to
- min heap to keep track of smallest (or priority queue)

= Turbo
- I'm a genius ?

= Intro caching
- Beladys algorithm
- if cache_miss, remove the one used the furthest into the future
- implement that shit ^
- minheap or something
- vec<queue<int>>

= SetStack
- Anton is a genius
