//  Implement a function solving as many variables as possible from a linear equation system, Ax = b, where A is a n×n matrix and b is a n×1 vector, even if the system is under determined. For example, given the system:
// x1 	-2·x2 		= 	3
// 2·x1 	-4·x2 		= 	6
// x1 	-2·x2 	+x3 	= 	4
// 
// we can solve x3 = 1, while x1 and x2 cannot be determined. If the system does not have a solution this should be detected.
// 
// Recommended time complexity: O(n³).
