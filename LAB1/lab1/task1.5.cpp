//  Implement a data structure to handle prefix sums of an array a[0], a[1], ..., a[N-1], with the following operations:
// 
//     add(index i, number delta) - increase a[i] with delta
//     number sum(index end) - compute the sum of the first numbers up to, but not including, a[end]
// 
// Recommended time complexity: O(log n) for both operations, where n is the number of elements in the array.
// 
// Warning: Even with a correct imlementation, Python is probably too slow to solve this assignment.
