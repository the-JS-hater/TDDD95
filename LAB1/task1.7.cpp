//  Implement a function solving linear equation systems, Ax = b, where A is a n×n matrix and b is a n×1 vector.
// 
// If the system does not have a unique solution, i.e. the matrix A is singular, this should be detected. There are two cases to separate: systems with more than one solution and systems without a solution. Be aware of corner cases and numerical stability.
// 
// The function will be more useful if it is posible to choose the coefficient type using templates/generics, for example rationals, floats or integers modulo p, but it is not required.
// 
// Recommended time complexity: O(n³).
