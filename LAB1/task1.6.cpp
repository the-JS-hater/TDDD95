//  Implement multiplication of two polynomials using the Fast Fourier Transform.
// 
// Recommended time complexity: O(n log n), where n is the order of the resulting polynomial.
// 
// Note: There is also a simpler problem polymul1 where a quadratic algorithm is sufficient. While you are free to use this problem for testing etc., you will not receive any points for solving this simpler problem.
